# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### Retiring Employees
Pewlett-Hackard is concerned about the number of employees eligible for retirement. The company would like to know exactly how many employees are eligible for retirement by department and by title. Those eligible for retirement were born in the years between 1952 and 1955 inclusively.

### Mentors
The company is also considering a mentorship program. They would like to consider those current employees born in 1965 eligible mentors. 

## Results

### Retiring Employees
* Senior posistions will see the most retirees, which is to be expected as they gain that status with experience. However, as we look at percentages of retirees in each title, we see that around 30% of each title group will be retiring in the next few years. 

* The exception is Managers, they will have 22% elibible for retirement.

* Each department will see approximately 30% of their employees retire over the next few years.

* Only 1.3% of current employees are eligible for the mentorship program. This is not nearly enough to fill the needs left behind by the retirees.

## Summary
In total over 72,000 of the 240,000 employees at Pewlett Hackard will be retiring in the next few years. Again, that is almost a third of the current work force at the company. I don't believe the 1.3% of current employees eligibile for mentorship are adequate, those parameters will have to be adjusted to allow the company to better set the compay up for this wave of retirements.
